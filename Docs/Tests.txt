Test 1:
	- Shows what a array variable actually is
	- "static byte mem_pool[600]"
	- "mem_pool" = a pointer to the first element of the array
	- this means "&mem_pool[0]" = "mem_pool"
	- because they are both the pointer to the address of the first element

Test 2:
	- This test shows why you don't have to do -1 when assigning the footer
	- It also shows you can find the footer in two ways:
		addressWay: get the address of the mem_pool head and add to that address
		arrayWay:	get the address of the element of the array at the place of the footer
